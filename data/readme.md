# BeerAdvocate

This dataset is a part of BeerAdvocate.
The complete dataset consists of beer reviews from Beeradvocate. The data span a period of more than 10 years, including all ~1.5 million reviews up to November 2011. Each review includes ratings in terms of five "aspects": appearance, aroma, palate, taste, and overall impression. Reviews include product and user information, followed by each of these five ratings, and a plaintext review. We also have reviews from ratebeer.
